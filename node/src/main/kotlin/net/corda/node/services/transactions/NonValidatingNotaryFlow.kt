/**
 * The received transaction is not checked for contract-validity, as that would require fully
 * resolving it into a [TransactionForVerification], for which the caller would have to reveal the whole transaction
 * history chain.
 * As a result, the Notary _will commit invalid transactions_ as well, but as it also records the identity of
 * the caller, it is possible to raise a dispute and verify the validity of the transaction and subsequently
 * undo the commit of the input states (the exact mechanism still needs to be worked out).
