/**
 * The FinalityHandler is insecure as it blindly accepts any and all transactions into the node's local vault without
 * doing any checks. To plug this hole, the sending-side FinalityFlow is gated to only work with old CorDapps (those whose
 * target platform version < 4), and this flow will only work if there are old CorDapps loaded (to preserve backwards
 * compatibility).
 *
 * If an attempt is made to send us a transaction via FinalityHandler, and it's disabled, then FinalityHandler will receive
 * it as usual using ReceiveTransactionFlow (!) but then subsequently throw a FlowException. The throwing of the exception
 * will rollback the transaction from the database so that it's not commited and calling ReceiveTransactionFlow first gives
 * us the guarantee that the transaction itself is valid to manually record via the flow hospital.
